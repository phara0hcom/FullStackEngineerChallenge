# Description

This is a short overview of the stack that I used and the reason behind it.

## Environment
Firstly I wanted to use Docker for ease of use of setup so that the people that use this app don't have to install mySQL, NodeJS etc. Also running it in one command line is nice. And I wanted to challenge myself since I've never make a container myself.

## Back-End
Since I know Javascript and have worked before with NodeJS and Express this is an easy choice for me. I've never worked with MySql and NodeJS before in the past I worked with it with PHP. But it seems easy enough, just hope I don't make any mistakes and open my app up for a MySql injection.

## Front-End
Since this is my bread and butter I will use react-create-app because it's a fast way to get started. Also I'm using TypeScript since not so long ago I started implementing it in my current jobs One Page App. I'm more familiar with Redux and React-Router.

Will use Bootstrap since it's out of the box looks nice and is easy to use.
